An amazing PWA which is a solution to foretell the likelihood of being in vicinity of COVID-19 and has the following features:


<OL>
<LI style="color:#83BB12"> <B> Prediction model* </B> <BR>  </LI>
This would be used for providing the likelihood of the disease based on various factors. <BR> <BR>

<LI style="color:#83BB12"> <B> Interactive Chatbot </B> <BR> </LI>
This is an interactive bot which will resolve all your queries related to the disease and provide implementable solutions to them. <BR> <BR>

<LI style="color:#83BB12"> <B> Some useful insights </B> <BR> </LI>
In addition to the above, we would also be providing useful insights from our end, which would prove to be beneficial. <BR> <BR>

<LI style="color:#83BB12"> <B> The current situation's overview </B> <BR> </LI>
We would also be giving the latest updates and overview of the on-going situation to help you keep track of it. <BR> <BR>

<B> Prerequisites </B> <BR>
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Learning Model) and Flask (for API)
installed.
Here are the links help install them, if you don't: <BR>
Scikit Learn : &nbsp <A href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#install-official-release"> Learn to install </A> <BR>
Pandas : &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <A href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Using pip </A> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <A href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/"> Using anaconda </A> <BR>
Flask : &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp 
<A href="https://dev.to/sahilrajput/install-flask-and-create-your-first-web-application-2dba"> Learn to install </A> <BR> <BR>

<B> Model Structure </B> <BR>
This deployed model has four major parts : 
<OL style="margin-top: 0">
<LI>
model.py - This contains code for our Machine Learning model to predict
Covid19 on training data in 'Cleaned-data.csv' file.
<LI> 
app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives user input through GUI and
computes the predicted value based on our model and returns it.
<LI>
templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter
their details and symptoms and displays the predicted output.
<LI>
ml.pkl â€“ This contains the pickle file of the predictor.
</OL>

<B> Running the Deployed Model </B> <BR> 
1. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API. <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp Ensure that you are in
the local directory of the model containing app.py and ml.pkl file. <BR>
